  # Basic options
  environment-file:
    description: >-
      Required.
      The 'environment.yml' or '.lock' file for the Conda environment.
      If 'false', only `extra-specs` will be considered and you should provide 'channels'.
      If both 'environment-file' and 'extra-specs' are empty,
      no enviroment will be created (only Micromamba will be installed).
      See the [Conda documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file)
      for more information.
    required: true
    default: environment.yml
  environment-name:
    description: >-
      The name of the Conda environment. Defaults to name from the environment.yml file.
      Required if 'environment-file' is a '.lock' file or 'false'.
  micromamba-version:
    description: >-
      Version of micromamba to use, eg. '0.20'.
      See https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba/releases/ for a list of releases.
    required: true
    default: latest
  extra-specs:
    description: >-
      Additional specifications (packages) to install.
      Pretty useful when using matrix builds to pin versions of a test/run dependency.
      For multiple packages, use multiline syntax (see examples).
      Note that selectors
      (e.g. `sel(linux): my-linux-package`, `sel(osx): my-osx-package`, `sel(win): my-win-package`)
      are available.
  channels:
    description: >-
      Comma separated list of channels to use in order of priority (eg., `conda-forge,my-private-channel`)
  condarc-file:
    description: >-
      Path to a `.condarc` file to use. See the [Conda documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/configuration/)
      for more information.
  channel-priority:
    description: >-
      Channel priority to use. One of "strict", "flexible", and "disabled".
      See https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-channels.html#strict-channel-priority
      for more information.
    required: true
    default: strict

  # Caching options
  cache-downloads:
    description: >-
      If 'true', cache downloaded packages across calls to the provision-with-micromamba action.
      Cache invalidation can be controlled using the 'cache-downloads-key' option.
    required: true
    default: false
  cache-downloads-key:
    description: >-
      Custom download cache key used with 'cache-downloads: true'.
      The default download cache key will invalidate the cache once per day.
  cache-env:
    description: >-
      If 'true', cache installed environments across calls to the provision-with-micromamba action.
      Cache invalidation can be controlled using the 'cache-env-key' option.
    required: true
    default: false
  cache-env-key:
    description: >-
      Custom environment cache key used with 'cache-env: true'.
      With the default environment cache key, separate caches will be created for each
      operating system (eg., Linux) and platform (eg., x64) and day (eg., 2022-01-31),
      and the cache will be invalidated whenever the contents of 'environment-file' or 'extra-specs' change.
  # cache-env-always-update:
  #   description: >-
  #     (Not implemented)
  #     If 'true', run 'micromamba update' even if the environment was restored from cache
  #     to make sure your environment is always up-to-date.
  #   required: true
  #   default: false
  log-level:
    description: >-

      One of "trace", "debug", "info", "warning", "error", "critical", "off".
    default: info

  # Advanced options
  installer-url:
    description: >-
      Base URL to fetch Micromamba from. Files will be downloaded from
      `<base url>/<platform>/<version>`, eg. https://micro.mamba.pm/api/micromamba/linux-64/latest.
    required: true
    default: https://micro.mamba.pm/api/micromamba
